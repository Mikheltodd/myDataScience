    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology that fuels this verification system on nearly every website and application is the ever reliable, often quirky language of regular expressions, commonly shortened to regex, as we will use here, or regexp.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **regular expression** is a special sequence of characters that describe a pattern of text that should be found, or matched, in a string or document. By matching text, we can identify how often and where certain pieces of text occur, as well as have the opportunity to replace or update these pieces of text if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions have a variety of use cases including:\n",
    "* validating user input in HTML forms\n",
    "* verifying and parsing text in files, code and applications\n",
    "* examining test results\n",
    "* finding keywords in emails and web pages"

    "## Literals\n",
    "The simplest text we can match with regular expressions are _**literals**_. This is where our regular expression contains the exact text that we want to match. The regex `a`, for example, will match the text `a`, and the regex `bananas` will match the text `bananas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can additionally match just part of a piece of text. Perhaps we are searching a document to see if the word monkey occurs, since we love monkeys. We could use the regex monkey to match monkey in the piece of text The monkeys like to eat bananas..\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only are we able to match alphabetical characters — digits work as well! The regex 3 will match the 3 in the piece of text 34, and the regex 5 gibbons will completely match the text 5 gibbons!\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions operate by moving character by character, from left to right, through a piece of text. When the regular expression finds a character that matches the first piece of the expression, it looks to find a continuous sequence of matching characters."

    "## Alternation\n",
    "Do you love baboons and gorillas? You can find either of them with the same regular expression using alternation! Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, `|`, allows us to match either the characters preceding the `|` OR the characters after the `|`. The regex `baboons|gorillas` will match baboons in the text `I love baboons`, but will also match gorillas in the text `I love gorillas`."

    "## Character Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex `con[sc]en[sc]us` will match `consensus`, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: `concensus`, `consencus`, and `concencus`. The letters inside the first brackets, `s` and `c`, are the different possibilities for the character that comes after con and before en. Similarly for the second brackets, s and c are the different character possibilities to come after `en` and before `us`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the regex `[cat]` will match the characters c, a, or t, but not the text cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of character sets (and alternation) is that they allow our regular expressions to become more flexible and less rigid than by just matching with literals!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret `^` symbol. Placed at the front of a character set, the `^` negates the set, matching any character that is not stated. These are called negated character sets. Thus the regex `[^cat]` will match any character that is not c, a, or t, and would completely match each character d, o or g.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Wildcards `(.)` will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. They are useful when we do not care about the specific value of a character, but only that a character exists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we want to match any 9-character piece of text. The regex `.........` will completely match orangutan and marsupial! Similarly, the regex `I ate . bananas` will completely match both `I ate 3 bananas` and `I ate 8 bananas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to match an actual period, `.`,  We can use the escape character, `\\`, to escape the wildcard functionality of the `.` and match an actual period. The regex Howler monkeys are really lazy\\. will completely match the text Howler monkeys are really lazy.."

    "\n",
    "Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match without having to type out each individual character. The regex `[abc]`, which would match any character `a`, `b`, or `c`, is equivalent to regex range `[a-c]`. The `-` character allows us to specify that we are interested in matching a range of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex `I adopted [2-9] [b-h]ats` will match the text `I adopted 4 bats` as well as `I adopted 8 cats` and even `I adopted 5 hats`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With ranges we can match any single capital letter with the regex `[A-Z]`, lowercase letter with the regex `[a-z]`, any digit with the regex `[0-9]`. We can even have multiple ranges in the same character set! To match any single capital or lowercase alphabetical character, we can use the regex `[A-Za-z]`.\n",

    "## Shorthand Character Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "While character ranges are extremely useful, they can be cumbersome to write out every single time you want to match common ranges such as those that designate alphabetical characters or digits. To alleviate this pain, there are shorthand character classes that represent common ranges, and they make writing regular expressions much simpler. These shorthand classes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\w`: the “word character” class represents the regex range `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and it matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore\n",
    "* `\\d`: the “digit character” class represents the regex range `[0-9]`, and it matches a single digit character\n",
    "* `\\s`: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[ \\t\\r\\n\\f\\v]`, matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the regex `\\d\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w` matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. Thus the regex completely matches the text `3 monkeys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the shorthand character classes `\\w`, `\\d`, and `\\s`, we also have access to the negated shorthand character classes! These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. These negated shorthand classes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\W`: the “non-word character” class represents the regex range `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by \\w\n",
    "* `\\D`: the “non-digit character” class represents the regex range `[^0-9]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by \\d\n",

    "\n",
    "Grouping, denoted with the open parenthesis `(` and the closing parenthesis `)`, lets us group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of the regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex `I love (baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love` and then match either `baboons` or `gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the | to the text within the parentheses.\n",

    "Instead of writing the regex `\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w`, which would match 6 word characters, followed by a whitespace character, and then followed by more 6 word characters, there is a better way to denote the quantity of characters we want to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed quantifiers, denoted with curly braces `{}`, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\w{3}` will match exactly 3 word characters\n",
    "* `\\w{4,7}` will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters\n",

    "The regex `roa{3}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by 3 `a`s, and then the character `r`, such as in the text roaaar. The regex `roa{3,7}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by at least 3 `a`s and at most 7 `a`s, followed by an r, matching the strings roaaar, roaaaaar and roaaaaaaar.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be greedy. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex mo{2,4} will match the text moooo in the string moooo, and not return a match of moo, or mooo. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of os as possible, which is 4 in the string moooo."

For example, the regex `humou?r` matches the characters `humo`, then either `0` occurrences or `1` occurrence of the letter `u`, and finally the letter `r`. Note the `?` only applies to the character directly before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all quantifiers, we can take advantage of grouping to make even more advanced regexes. The regex `The monkey ate a (rotten )?banana` will completely match both `The monkey ate a rotten banana` and `The monkey ate a banana`.\n",

    "Since the `?` is a metacharacter, you need to use the escape character in your regex in order to match a question mark ? in a piece of text. The regex `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful\\?` will thus completely match the text `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful?`."
